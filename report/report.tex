\section{Background}
This report focuses on simulating simple social media networks,
and evaluates the effectiveness of a network given parameters
of that network.\\
The social network consists of a set of users that may follow eachother,
which has been represented in code as a directed graph. Users may not follow themselves,
or follow eachother more than once.\\
There exists only one post at a time, with a new post being loaded when the current
post has not had any activity in the last timestep. The original poster always
likes their own post. A user can only like a post once.\\
The simulation consists
of timesteps, with a function \texttt{update()} to move between timesteps.
The update algorithm works as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Check that there exists some users that have liked the post in the previous timestep.
            If there are none, the update ends and the next post is loaded.
    \item Iterate through all users who liked the post in the previous timestep.
            Each of their followers is 'exposed' to the post, and have a chance of liking the post.
            This chance is sampled from a Bernoulli distribution with probability
            $\mathit{clamp}\left(\mathit{prob\_like} \times \mathit{clickbait\_factor}, 0, 1\right)$.
    \item If a user likes a post in the current timestep, they have a chance of following the
            original poster. This is sampled using the same technique as above, with global probability
            $\mathit{prob\_foll}$.
\end{enumerate}
Note that in the above algorithm, if a user does not like a post, they may potentially
be exposed to it later via a different friend. This behaviour is intentional, as it incentivises
a highly connected network.

Parameters that will be tracked before, during, and after the simulation include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Clustering Coefficient
    \item Average and s.d. of followers per user
\end{itemize}

Some parameters that will be varied in the creation of the social network include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Probability of liking a post
    \item Probability of following a user
    \item Number of users
    \item Selection of Clickbait Factor
\end{itemize}

The main metric of a social networks performance, from a monetary perspective,
is likes per person per post, which will be measured during simulation of the network.
\section{Methodology}

\section{Results}

\subsection{Time}
It was found that clustering coefficient did not change significantly over the
course of the simulation, and either increases or decreases by around 1\% over the course of the simulation.
This suggests that over time, friend groups do not become more or less clustered, and remain approximately the same.
This makes sense, as the proportion of posts a friend group will be exposed to within the group
is proportional to the clustering of the group itself.

Another result that was found was that the standard deviation of the follower count
decreased over time in almost all cases. The only exception to this was where the
standard deviation of the follower count was 0. This shows that, over time, the
social network will become more equitable, with famous people becoming less popular
over time. However, this is based off the assumption that there is no difference
in content between x and y. This can be observed in real life.

As expected, follower count and number of likes consistently increased over time.
However, what is interesting is how they increased over time. (Insert graphs).
This is applicable to social networks, where a large factor in a persons online popularity
is related to how many posts they have.

\subsection{Size}
Even when scaled for network size, the number of likes consistently increased
when the size of the network was increased.
